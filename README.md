# Automated-Wastewater-Treatment-Bottle-Filling-Station-PLC-Supervision-with-RSLogix-RSView
This project designs and simulates an industrial system combining wastewater purification and automated bottle filling. Developed using Rockwell Automation tools (RSLogix, RSView, RSLinx).
Multi-stage treatment process (biological, chemical, filtration).

PLC-controlled automation with sensors, pumps, and alarms.

GRAFCET modeling for sequence logic.

RSView HMI for real-time monitoring and fault management.

Ideal for learning industrial automation, PLC programming, and SCADA integration.
